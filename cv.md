> **"** Hi there!
> I've about 15 years of hands-on development experience, the last four of which had plenty of management challenges as well.
> 
> I have set up methodology, platform & tooling from the ground up for a distributed development process, employing modern approaches such as Agile & CI, have matured and scaled said process.
> 
> I've made design, implementation & choice decisions for tech stacks beginning with the infrastructure layer (hardware, networking, virtualization), have chosen, scaled & optimized persistence layers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Mongo, Redis..), have authored & architected applications & services written in Python, PHP & NodeJS through to the writing in Javascript & Coffeescript on the client.
